<p>The <a href="WaveFile.html">WaveFile</a> gem lets you read and write wave
files.</p>

<p>Reading is done using the Reader class, and writing is done using the
Writer class.</p>

<p>The Buffer class represents a collection of samples in a given sample
format (e.g. stereo 16-bit PCM samples at a 44,100Hz sample rate). When
samples are read using Reader they are returned in Buffer instances.
Samples to be written are given to Writer wrapped in Buffer instances as
well.</p>

<p>A Buffer consists of two parts: an array of samples, and a Format instance
that describes the sample format (since it might not be possible to
determine just by looking at the raw samples). For example, the sample
array in a Buffer read out of a mono 8-bit PCM file (in which each sample
is an integer between 0 and 255) might look like this:</p>

<pre>[45, 192, 13, 231, 201, 101, 15, ...etc...]</pre>

<p>When there is more than one channel, each sample frame will be represent by
a sub array. For example, a set of stereo floating point samples (in which
each sample is between -1.0 and 1.0) might look like this:</p>

<pre>[[-0.2, 0.4], [0.3, 0.9], [-0.4, -0.8], [0.9, -0.2], [-0.3, 0.4], ...etc...]</pre>

<p>When writing a program that creates sound, you would generate an array like
this with the sample data, then wrap it in a Buffer, and then use Writer to
write the samples in the Buffer to disk.</p>

<p>Buffers have the ability to convert their samples to any other format this
gem supports. This means you can read samples from a file in whatever
format you like, regardless of the actual sample format in the file (e.g.
read a file with 8-bit samples and get 16-bit samples back). You can also
do the same with Writer - for example, rather than remember the sample
range of a PCM format (was it 32,767? or 32,768?) you can just generate
floating point samples between -1.0 and 1.0, and transparently write them
out as PCM samples.</p>
