    # Public: Creates a new Buffer.
    #
    # samples - An array of samples. If the Format has 1 channel (i.e. is mono), this
    #           should be a flat array of samples such as <code>[0.5, 0.4, -0.3, ...]</code>.
    #           If the Format has 2 or more channels the array should include a sub-array for
    #           each sample frame. For example, <code>[[0.5, 0.2], [0.1, 0.6], [-0.2, 0.4], ...]</code>
    #           for a stereo file.
    #
    #           The individual samples should match the given format:
    #
    #           :pcm_8    - Integer between 0 and 255
    #           :pcm_16   - Integer between -32_768 and 32_767
    #           :pcm_24   - Integer between -8_388_608 and 8_388_607
    #           :pcm_32   - Integer between 2_147_483_648 and 2_147_483_647
    #           :float    - Float between -1.0 and 1.0
    #           :float_32 - Float between -1.0 and 1.0
    #           :float_64 - Float between -1.0 and 1.0
    #
    # format - A Format instance which describes the sample format of the sample array.
    #
    #          Note that the sample array is not compared with the format to make sure
    #          they match - you are on the honor system to make sure they do. If they
    #          don't match, unexpected things will happen.
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   samples = ([0.5] * 50) + ([-0.5] * 50)   # A floating point 440Hz mono square wave
    #   buffer = Buffer.new(samples, Format.new(:mono, :float, 44100)
    #
    #   samples = ([0.5, 0.5] * 50) + ([-0.5, -0.5] * 50)   # A 440Hz stereo square wave
    #   buffer = Buffer.new(samples, Format.new(2, :float, 44100)
    #
    #   samples = ([16000] * 50) + ([-16000] * 50)   # A 16-bit PCM 440Hz mono square wave
    #   buffer = Buffer.new(samples, Format.new(1, :pcm_16, 44100)

    # Public: Creates a new Buffer containing the sample data of this Buffer, but converted
    # to a different format.
    #
    # new_format - The format that the sample data should be converted to. If the new format
    #              has a different number of channels than the original buffer format, the sample data
    #              will be converted in the following way:
    #
    #              1 -> n: Each mono sample will be duplicated into the new number of channels.
    #
    #              n -> 1: Each sample in each sample frame will be averaged into a single sample.
    #
    #              (n > 2) -> 2: The first two channels will be kept, all other channels discarded.
    #
    #              other: Unsupported, will cause BufferConversionError to be raised.
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   new_format = Format.new(:mono, :pcm_16, 44100)
    #   new_buffer = old_buffer.convert(new_format)

    #              for how samples will be mapped if the new number of channels differs from
