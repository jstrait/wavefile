  # Public: Error that is raised when constructing a SamplerInfo instance that is invalid.
  #         "Invalid" means that one or more fields have a value that can't be encoded in the
  #         field inside a *.wav file. For example, there's no way to encode "-23" as a value
  #         for the midi_note field. However, this error _won't_ be raised for values that
  #         can be encoded, but aren't semantically correct. For example, it's possible to
  #         construct a SamplerInfo instance with a midi_note value of 10000, which can be
  #         encoded in a *.wav file, even though this isn't a valid value in real life.
  class InvalidSamplerInfoError < StandardError; end

  # Public: Provides a way to indicate the data contained in a "smpl" chunk.
  #         That is, information about how the *.wav file could be used by a
  #         sampler, such as the file's MIDI note or loop points. If a *.wav
  #         file contains a "smpl" chunk, then Reader.sampler_info will
  #         return an instance of this object with the relevant info.

    # manufacturer_id - the ID of the manufacturer that this sample is intended for. If it's not
    #                   intended for a sampler from a particular manufacturer, this should be 0.
    #                   See the list at https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/manufacturer-id-numbers
    # product_id - the ID of the product made by the manufacturer this sample is intended for.
    #              If not intended for a particular product, this should be 0.
    # sample_nanoseconds - the length of each sample in nanoseconds, which is typically determined by
    #                      converting <code>1 / sample rate</code> (in seconds) into nanoseconds.
    #                      For example, with a sample rate of 44100 this would be 22675 nanoseconds. However,
    #                      this can be set to an arbitrary value to allow for fine tuning.
    # midi_note - the MIDI note number of the sample. Should be between 0 and 127.
    # fine_tuning_cents - the number of cents >= 0.0 and < 100.0 the note should be tuned up from the midi_note
    #                     field. 100 cents is equal to one semitone. For example, if this value is 50.0, and
    #                     midi_note is 60, then the sample is tuned half-way between MIDI note 60 and 61. If the
    #                     value is 0, then the sample has no fine tuning.
    # smpte_format - the SMPTE format. Should be 0, 24, 25, 29 or 30.
    # smpte_offset - a SMPTETimecode representing the SMPTE time offset.
    # loops - an Array of 0 or more SamplerLoop objects containing loop point info. Loop point info
    #         can indicate that (for example) the sampler should loop between a given sample range as long
    #         as the sample is played.
    # sampler_specific_data - a String of data specific to the intended target sampler, or nil if there is no sampler
    #                         specific data.
    #
    # Raises InvalidSamplerInfoError if the given arguments are can't be written to a *.wav file.
