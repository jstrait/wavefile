module WaveFile
  # Public: Calculates playback time given the number of sample frames and the sample rate.
  # For example, you can use this to calculate how long a given Wave file is.
  #
  # The hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds fields return values like you would
  # see on a stopwatch, and not the total amount of time in that unit. For example, a
  # stopwatch running for exactly 2 hours would show something like "2:00:00.000".
  # Accordingly, if the given sample frame count and sample rate add up to exactly
  # 2 hours, then hours will be 2, and minutes, seconds, and milliseconds will all be 0.
  class Duration
    # Public: Constructs a new immutable Duration.
    #
    # sample_frame_count - The number of sample frames, i.e. the number
    #                      samples in each channel.
    # sample_rate - The number of samples per second, such as 44100
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   duration = Duration.new(400_000_000, 44100)
    #   duration.hours         # => 2
    #   duration.minutes       # => 31
    #   duration.seconds       # => 10
    #   duration.milliseconds  # => 294

    # Public: Returns true if this Duration represents that same amount of time as
    # other_duration.
    #
    # Two Duration instances will evaluate as == if they correspond
    # to the same "stopwatch time". This means that two Durations constructed
    # from a different number of sample frames or different sample rates can be
    # considered equal if they correspond to the same amount
    # of time. For example, a Duration from 44,100 sample frames
    # at 44,100 samples/sec will be considered equal to a Duration
    # from 22,050 sample frames at 22,050 samples/sec, because
    # both correspond to 1 second of audio.
    #
    # Since the finest resolution of a duration is 1 millisecond,
    # two Durations that represent different amounts of time but
    # differ by less than 1 millisecond will be considered equal.
