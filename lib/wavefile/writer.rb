module WaveFile
  # Provides the ability to write data to a wave file.
  #
  # When a Writer is constructed it can be given a block. All samples should be written inside this 
  # block, and when the block exits the file will automatically be closed:
  #
  #    Writer.new("my_file.wav", Format.new(:mono, :pcm_16, 44100)) do |writer|
  #      # Write sample data here
  #    end
  #
  # If no block is given, you'll need to manually close the Writer when done. The underlaying 
  # file will not be valid or playable until close is called.
  #
  #    writer = Writer.new("my_file.wav", Format.new(:mono, :pcm_16, 44100))
  #    # Write sample data here
  #    writer.close

    # Padding value written to the end of chunks whose payload is an odd number of bytes. The RIFF 
    # specification requires that each chunk be aligned to an even number of bytes, even if the byte 
    # count is an odd number.
